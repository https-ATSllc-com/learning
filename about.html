    <p class="psgs"> Hi!, I am mandela P Thomas a programmer and cyber forensics Investigator studying Cyber Security at GCU.

      However, I was born and raised in West Africa, Liberia. Growing up, I had a unique perspective of the world - being an African and a black,
      I learned everyone has a story to tell, and it's important to be open to change and fresh ideas.

<p class="psgs">I found a love for technology and investigation at my teen age years while in the  third grade during high school.

After personal struggles with anxiety and depression, I became fascinated with the way people think, feel, and behave - and how technology could help them live more fulfilling lives.

I'm a currently ongoing my  Bachelars degree at the Grand Canyon University Phoenix,Arizona, with Bachelor of Science in Computer science with Emphasis in Cyber Security.
</p><p class="psgs"> However, during the years,  I finished up an 8-month personal research project for how technology  can better work with codes, as well learning people mind  and actions of their daily living.
I'm currently using this research to help build out a world avance software for investigation.

Outside of Programming, I'm a major soccer player, and enjoy exploring on the field.

</p>
<p class="psgs">I'm always willing to  collaborate when comes to innovative ideas. In so, I am a  self-taught full-stack Web Developer,Programmer
  ,Designer, Cyber Forensic Investigator,CTO,Student,International Entrepreneur For The Mandela Technology Solutions Center (www.mtsc.com).</p>
